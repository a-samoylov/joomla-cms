# GSoC Webservices 2019 Submission

This page to record the progress made during Google Summer of Code program in the last three months.

## About the project

This project is a continuation of the implementation of webservices in Joomla. Webservices are API layer that helps third-party developers work with a Joomla website. This can significantly improve the popularity of Joomla CMS, because it will help to create very functional and complex integrations with sites made on Joomla.

## Work done
You can get vew the **specification** of the project [here](https://github.com/joomla-projects/gsoc19_webservices/blob/master/manual/en-US/gsoc-2019/specification.md).

During the work on the project, implemented **API layers for core Joomla components** and **documentation**, implementation of **API for Weblinks extension** and **guideline** how to implement it.

To work with the Joomla API **documentation** you can get it here [here](https://docs.joomla.org/J4.x:Joomla_Core_APIs).

##

It was necessary to implement an **API for Joomla weblinks extension**, it is important to create a guideline for the community.

Code: [Pull request](https://github.com/joomla-extensions/weblinks/pull/407)

**Instructions for implementing the component** have been created and you can find it [here](https://docs.joomla.org/J4.x:Adding_an_API_to_a_Joomla_Component).

## More Work
We covered almost all the components we wanted! But three webservices remained in the work: com_finder, com_contenthistory, com_media.

To the additional task that was associated with the entity level, we did not have enough time to design a solution for it in full.
